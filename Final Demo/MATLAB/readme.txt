Readme for MATLAB Code for Fonal Demo.
Welcome to Edgar's MATLAB simulations/files. Not much has changed.
We simulated the PI controllers for both motors/wheels. A step response experiment 
(FinalDemoInnerControl) was performed, measuring the position of both 
wheels and this was used to help us tune the PI controller 
(FinalDemoOuterControl) for the wheels acting together as one. The 
files are named as described and the simulink file name matches the 
corresponding .m file.The simulations were mostly helpful in identifying how to 
change the control based off wjat state wdgar was in.
