Readme for MATLAB Code.
Welcome to Edgar's MATLAB simulations/files. We simulated the PI 
controllers for both motors/wheels. A step response experiment 
(RhoStepExperiment.m) was performed, measuring the position of both 
wheels and this was used to help us tune the PI controller 
(FinalDemo1ControlCode.m) for the wheels acting together as one. The 
files are named as described and the simulink file name matches the 
corresponding .m file. A pdf of published code for the step experiment 
and PI controller should be attached along with them as well.
