Miniproject MATLAB readme

Code used for System Control - Elijah Ball

This Folder of the MiniProject holds the Matlab code used to tune the motor with a PI controller. There are two m files used. One finds an open step response and the other finds a closed step response. motorSim4p6.m holds the code that models a transfer function of the motor used and models it so a PI can tune it. MotorControl4p7.m holds the code that imoplments a PI controller to get the step response to meet the desired requeirment of low overshoot and a quick rise time. There is a simulink file attached to both .m files. The code is published and can be found in the PDF documents in the Github repisitory or it is submitted on canvas under ELijah Ball.
